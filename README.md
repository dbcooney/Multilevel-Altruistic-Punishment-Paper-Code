# Multilevel-Altruistic-Punishment-Paper-Code

This repository accompanies the preprint "Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection", by Daniel B. Cooney. It will include all of the scripts used to generate the figures in the paper.

The repository is organized into three folders: Scripts, Figures, and Simulation Outputs. All of the scripts can be run using Python 3.10.

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.

- Figure 2.1: Run within_trimorphic_altruistic.py
- Figure 4.1: Run group_local_density.py
- Figure 4.2: Run Gdiff_threshold.py
- Figure 4.3: Run Gdiff_threshold.py
